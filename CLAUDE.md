About the project
- ML Pipeline to predict different temperatures(eg - melting) of an antibody given the structure of it

About the codebase
-  At any point in time, this is `./abmelt_infer_pipeline` the only code you should concern yourself with, This codebase reimplements the abmelt research paper from the original implementation so as to benchmark on a public dataset
- Current goal is to reproduce the results for a single antibody end to end
